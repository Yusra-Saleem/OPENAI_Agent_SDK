# Markdown Cheatsheet

## ðŸ“– What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. Itâ€™s widely used for documentation, blog posts, and notes because of its simplicity and readability. It converts simple symbols into rich text formatting.

## 1. Headings

Headings create titles and section headers in your document. There are six levels of headings, from largest to smallest.

### Syntax

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
```

**Best Practice:** Always include a space between the `#` sign and the heading text.

## 2. Paragraphs and Line Breaks

- **Paragraphs:** Use a blank line to separate paragraphs.

```markdown
This is the first paragraph.

This is the second paragraph.
```

- **Line Breaks:** End a line with two or more spaces or use the `<br>` tag.

```markdown
This is the first line.  
This is the second line.
```

## 3. Emphasis (Bold & Italic)

- *Italic:* `*italic*` or `_italic_`
- **Bold:** `**bold**` or `__bold__`
- ***Bold + Italic:*** `***bold italic***`

```markdown
*italic text*
**bold text**
***bold and italic***
```
